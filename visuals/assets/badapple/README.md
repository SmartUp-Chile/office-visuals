# Bad Apple ASCII Frames

This folder stores the cached ASCII frames file (`badapple.txt`) that the `Bad Apple` visual downloads automatically from [`skanehira/badapple.vim`](https://github.com/skanehira/badapple.vim) (MIT License).

If the file is missing, the visual will try to download it on demand. You can also place your own ASCII frames file here to override the default.
